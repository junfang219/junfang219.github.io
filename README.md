# VisualBayesianTree

This is a Bayesian tree of the breast cancer problem.

The tool enables user to plug probability/percentage of each branch/event and caculate the smallest possible population size of the problem. Given the smallest popolation size (e.g., 1000) and frequency of each event, it would be easier and more intuitive to understand the problem.



The tool is implemented in Javascript and use the decimal.js library to handle the float problem. The tool takes care of the responsive issue and can be used in multiple devices.



The future implementations include 1) enabling the combination of percentage and probability and frequency to solve a problem, 2) enabling the editing the frequencies (now is only as output), 3) enabling editing the tables and make it react to the tree, 4) providing guidance to use the tree.
